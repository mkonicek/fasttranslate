I have a lot of international friends on facebook and chat in up to five 
languages and needed a quick way to look up words while switching languages 
frequently. 
I built this add-on for myself on top of Google translate API and I'm happy 
with the result - FastTranslate is awesome! :)

(this is my first Firefox add-on and my first javascript project)

=============
Update:

The Google translate user interface improved a lot since I wrote this add-on.
I also switched from Firefox to Chrome since. As a result, sadly, this
add-on is no longer maintained.
