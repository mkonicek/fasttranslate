I have a lot of international friends on facebook
and I usually chat in up to 5 languages.
I built this add-on for myself because all existing solutions
were frustrating. Now I'm happy - FastTranslate is awesome! :)

https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/fast-translate/

Uses Google translate API, but since this API will shutdown by the end of the year,
will switch to Bing API.
Chrome version to come!

(this is my first Firefox add-on and first javascript project)
