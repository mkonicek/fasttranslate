== Code overview

There are 3 types of languages:
  * defaultLang - the "native" language of user's browser
  * starredLangs - user's favorite languages, on the right in the UI
  * targetLang - the selected 

The logic is the following:
Autodetect the language of the input (autodetect is reliable enough, we don't want to bother the user with manually specifying source lang).
If text is in foreing language, translate foreign->native(defaultLang).
If text is in native language (defaultLang), translate native->targetLang.
